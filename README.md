# vehicle_detection
The project is done as part of Udacity self Driving Car Nano Degree Program. vehicle detection in a video stream.

The project deal with training a model for vehicle classification and then detects and tracks the vehicle in a video stream.

Linear SVM was used as  classifier with HOG, color Histogram and spacial features being extracted from images during training.

The images  used in the projects are combination of  GTI vehicle image database, the KITTI vision benchmark suite.  

The actual data used for training can be obtained from links below:
